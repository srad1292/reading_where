# 1. MVP

- Done

# 2. Make it nice

- Flag image caching for improved speed on page
- Flag images: something to help the white parts of flag not being lost to background?

# 3. Analytics

- Figure out what data I want to track and how I want to display it
- Average rating by region (KPI Number)
- Region completion percentage (horizontal bar)
- Average rating by region (horizontal bar)
- Author gender (horizontal bar)
- Fiction vs nonfiction (horizontal bar)

# 4. Improvements after using it for a while

- [] Update rating selection/display
- [] Add ability to add a book that open library doesn't find
- [] Add ability to update title
- [] Something in book list display to show country has options
- Find a book that is already in my list
- [] Don't exclude unread books from quote page
- [] Disable save buttons if title/country not set

# 5. Book List Filter

- Decide if I actually care about this
- Book List Filter: Create Page
- Book List: When pop from filter page, use filter to update display

# 6. Things I've decided against but want to keep a note of

- Book Information: If db book has image, show, otherwise get from API
- Book Information: If saving and image not already in db book, save image as well
